# Generate Journal Entry

Generate a polished journal entry from the journal plan.

## Usage

```
/journal N
```

Where N is the entry number from the journal plan.

## Execution

**CRITICAL**: This command MUST run in a subagent with fresh context to avoid exhausting the main conversation's context window.

Use the Task tool with:
- `subagent_type`: "general-purpose"
- `prompt`: Include all instructions below plus the entry number N

## Subagent Instructions

The subagent should:

1. Read `~/garden/drafts/YYYYMMDD-journal-plan.md` (today's date)
2. Find Entry N in the plan
3. Read only the drafts listed for that entry
4. Load the journal-writer skill from `~/.me/claude/skills/journal-writer/SKILL.md`
5. Synthesize those drafts into a focused journal entry
6. Follow the voice, style, and structure from the skill
7. Add appropriate wikilinks to technical terms
8. Save to `~/garden/entries/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
9. Set `draft: true` in frontmatter for review
10. Run `pre-commit run mdformat --files ~/garden/entries/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` to format the entry

## Output Location

Save the generated entry to: `~/garden/entries/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`

The slug should be derived from the entry title (lowercase, hyphenated).

## After Generation

1. Show the entry path
2. Move entry N's draft files from `~/garden/drafts/gardening/` to `~/garden/drafts/archive/`
3. Return summary: entry title, path, and suggestion to run `/publish`
